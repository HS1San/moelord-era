 Generic_Improve_Relations_with_Britain_desc:0 "While they may be the arch-imperialists, working with the British offers the best chance to modernize our airforce and ensure a steady flow of supplies."
 Generic_Improve_Relations_with_France_desc:0 "Even though the French have repeatedly humiliated us and forced new concessions on us, in the current situation we may well end up needing their help."
 Generic_Improve_Relations_with_America_desc:0 "East Asia has long had strong allies in the US. They represent the best chance of getting the support we need."
 Generic_Improve_Relations_with_Germany_desc:0 "The pariahs of Europe have made great strides in reforming their country and returning to their former glory. We can learn much from them."
 Generic_Improve_Relations_with_Italy_desc:0 "Whatever their designs on East Asia, the Italian have made it clear that they are willing to work with us if we show sufficient respect."
 Generic_Improve_Relations_with_Russia_desc:0 "The Russia has expressed an interest in East Asia, mainly to create a counter-weight to Japanese expansionism. We should send a mission to Moscow to see if our goals align."
 Generic_Protect_National_Citizens_desc:0 "Every man and woman most do their duty to protect the state. We will ensure they have the opportunity to do so."
 Generic_War_Plan_Against_Neighbors_desc:0 "Our neighbours are weakened by corruption and infighting. This presents a perfect opportunity to expand our territory."
 Generic_Join_to_Anhui_Clique_desc:0 "Anhui Clique is a powerful group in China and we can choose to join them to ensure our own safety."
 Generic_Join_to_Zhili_Clique_desc:0 "Zhili Clique is a powerful group in China and we can choose to join them to ensure our own safety."
 Generic_Join_to_Fengtian_Clique_desc:0 "Fengtian Clique is a powerful group in China and we can choose to join them to ensure our own safety."
 Generic_Remove_Political_Parties_desc:0 "Some insurgent political parties are occupying some places, and we must destroy them to defend our national security."
 Generic_Defeat_Imperialist_desc:0 "We stand today as one of the first nations that have thrown off the shackles of colonialism. it is our sacred duty to ensure that the other peoples in Asia can determine their own fate as well."
 Generic_Legacy_of_the_Ancient_Empire_desc:0 "We has stood as the dominant force in the East for millenia, guaranteeing peace and stability in the region. It is time we reclaim our former position."
 Generic_Plan_of_Reform_desc:0 "The modern age no longer allows our people to develop in blissful isolation. If we are to find our place in the sun, we need to take unprecedented leaps of reform and change this nation forever. This arduous journey begins now."
 Generic_Westernization_Movement_desc:0 "The old guard of our administrators is way too entrenched in our traditional values to be swayed by the waves of change. We shall uproot them ourselves then, and plant a younger, less moderate cabinet in their place."
 Generic_Diplomatic_Action_desc:0 "Some might find reaching out for help to the same people who exploited us not long ago humiliating. But in the end, there's no shame in restoring our former glory, and it would seem westernisation is by far our best bet."
 Generic_Establish_Military_Academies_desc:0 "Even the sharpest sword needs a capable hand to swing it. Our new academies shall turn our capable men into capable leaders for our new chain of command."
 Generic_Develop_Light_Industry_desc:0 "Even as war looms over us, the capability of our people must not be underestimated. Jumpstarting a strong civilian industry shall provide us with the tools we need to bring the true weapons of war into the assembly line."
 Generic_Construct_Roads_desc:0 "The ways of the old are gone, and you can't really supply a modern factory with donkeys. We must create a modern network of roads all around our urban regions that will ensure our materials and workforce will always be where they need to be."
 Generic_Develop_Heavy_Industry_desc:0 "A truck does not care if it's send to the fields or glorious battle, and neither does its factory. Our focus on our civilian economy must not be continued at the cost of our military undertaking."
 Generic_Reach_Out_To_the_Freedom_World_desc:0 "They may all be imperialists and exploiters, but it is the Entente who rose victorious from the Great War and won the entire world for themselves. We cannot yet afford to make enemies with those iron giants."
 Generic_Reach_Out_To_the_Iron_Blood_desc:0 "The winds of the world are changing. The Father of all Russians was crushed by the steel fist of communism, the man in Rome is dreaming himself an Empire of his own, and ll the world combined won't keep the Prussian spirit away from Weimar for long. Maybe this is exactly the opportunity we were looking for..."
 Generic_Aviation_Effort_desc:0 "The newborn concept of aerial warfare is advancing faster than any other aspect of modern combat. We must spend generously in making sure our planes are always on par with the times."
 Generic_Naval_Effort_desc:0 "China has miles and miles of useful coastline that is in our best interest to secure for our cause. Our dockyards must be greatly expanded and our research into light surface ships intensified."
 Generic_Army_Effort_desc:0 "Advances in naval and aerial combat open up more possibilities than we could ever imagine- but in the end it's the boots on the ground that win wars. By reforming our army system we can avoid reliving the hell of the trenches."
 Generic_Expand_Military_Academies_desc:0 "A well-organised General Staff is the key to planning complex operations. We should learn from the Western example and create a similar organisation."
 Generic_Ban_the_Opium_Trade_desc:0 "Opium is the instrument with which the powers of the West shattered this proud nation from within. We must undo these mistakes and get rid of this devil before it's too late."
 Generic_Permit_Opium_Trade_desc:0 "As abhorrent as its side effects are, opium presents to us a real opportunity to break our current economic stagnation. Permitting poppy cultivation on our fields shall go a long way to distracting our peasants from where our efforts are going."
 Generic_Rubber_Company_desc:0 "In vehicle design it sometimes is too easy to focus on the armor and guns until you forget about their humble support. We must establish lucrative deals with our rubber-producing companies to supply us with the needed supply for our tracks."
 Generic_Encourage_Study_Abroad_desc:0 "As much as it hurts us to admit, our schools no longer have the potential to recreate the great thinkers of the past. But the European ones do. Setting up a net of government subsidies for studying abroad will let us use the finest teachers of the West to create fine minds of our own."
 Generic_People_Morality_desc:0 "For thousands of years, officers were selected in stringent examinations. While the necessary texts may have changed, the principle remains the same."
 Generic_People_Welfare_desc:0 "A modern nation cannot let its citizens to die in the streets. We must look after our people and ensure they remain happy and productive- and willing to defend the nation in its time of need."
 Generic_People_Government_desc:0 "There is no tangible characteristic of belonging in a state, just the mere idea of belonging. Our government must strive to strengthen this idea in the minds of our people."
 Generic_People_Power_desc:0 "There is only so much we can change in this country before the peasants demand our heads- for now. By strengthening our political position amongst the populace we will find the support we need to do what needs to be done unimpeded."
 Generic_Expand_Arsenals_desc:0 "Try as we may, we will never get a steady supply of rifles from a toaster factory. With the assistance of our newfound friends we can set up a series of complexes specialized for the needs of the defense sector."
 Generic_Rectify_Discipline_desc:0 "Sending a thousand people to battle is useless if each of them only cares for himself; sending a million in the same way is tantamount to suicide. We must discipline our soldiers mercilessly, again and again, until we ensure not a single man will break at the sight of impending death."
 Generic_Flying_Circus_desc:0 "Air shows where talented young pilots push modern Western planes to their max are becoming quite popular among the common folk. Those brave souls will serve their motherland well on glorious battle; and their planes as well."
 Generic_Offensive_Effort_desc:0 "The experience of the Great War taught us that sitting crosslegged in a trench until you're blown up is not how you win a war. A series of lightning strikes to break the enemy's weak points and rout the rest shall leave our rivals no time to mobilise."
 Generic_Defensive_Effort_desc:0 "The experience of the Great War taught us that charging blindly into an enemy line is tantamount to suicide. Proper implementation of forts and barricades locking access to our key supply lines shall allow us to win any war of attrition."
 Generic_Develop_Modern_Agriculture_desc:0 "Agriculture is the foundation of a country. We must use advanced tools to accelerate the production of agriculture, which will help the population to improve."
 Generic_Expand_Opium_Cultivation_desc:0 "In a perfect world we could afford to choose where our income comes from. But we do not live in such a world; and the immense profits of the opium industry are waved to us like a carrot on a stick."
 Generic_Construct_Railways_desc:0 "Our proud nation is vast and untamed, and a trip from one side to the other can take days. By connecting the edges of our nation with high-speed railways we shall witness our industrial efficiency skyrocket."
 Generic_Aid_Victims_desc:0 "With the upheaval of the war, millions have been made homeless. We will create an agency to assist them in finding a new place to stay."
 Generic_National_Capitalism_desc:0 "It would seem that capitalism is the ultimate tool of economic ushering, and Western investors look like they're developing interest in our lands. Our policies must be quickly fine-tuned to encourage such foreign capital in our nation, not deter it."
 Generic_Gender_Equality_desc:0 "The more reactionary elements of our administration and society might not be too pleased about it, but allowing women equal opportunities to join our workforce and military is necessary to call ourselves a 20th century society. Besides, a working hand is a working hand."
 Generic_Free_Press_desc:0 "The problem with free publishing of news is that it uncovers the holes in our administration. But maybe that's exactly what we need - an outlet to the needs of the people, that will show us what we need to improve first."
 Generic_Request_International_Assistance_desc:0 "We simply do not have the industrial capacity to supply our countless troops by ourselves. Luckily, the great powers in the West seem at least lukewarm to our noble cause. Surely the Great War must have left a few guns rotting at a Western warehouse somewhere."
 Generic_Sea_Air_Cooperative_Operation_desc:0 "European experts seem convinced that a doctrine that successfully knits the air force and navy into close cooperation can yield massive advantages. We should look into that prospect ourselves."
 Generic_Special_Police_Force_desc:0 "We have need of elite forces; mountain troops and marines should be our priority."
 Generic_Legacy_of_the_Great_War_desc:0 "History seems to have forgotten the contribution of the brave Chinese men who helped win the Great War by carrying shovels and oats instead of guns. But we shall not; instead, those unsung heroes shall lend us their valuable experience in the intricate details of trench warfare."
 Generic_Expand_Railways_desc:0 "As our industrial might expands, so does our need for an extensive, efficient transportation network to get the fruits of our labor to where they can serve the state."
 Generic_Plan_of_Exploration_desc:0 "Our geologists have found a number of promising resource deposits within our territories. We can spend some capital to develop these fields. Advances in extraction technology might make more deposits viable for exploitation."
 Generic_Create_Research_Institutes_desc:0 "Now that our young scientists and professors return from their exile more capable than ever, we can finally begin to replicate the Western academia domestically. Government-funded research institutes will once again usher this nation a new Chinese golden age- as long as the government also gets what it wants."
 Generic_Reform_Tax_System_desc:0 "Our anachronistic economic policies no longer suffice to sustain the nation and are in desperate need of reform. Broadening our tax base is a good first step."
 Generic_New_Culture_Movement_desc:0 "The stale culture is destined to be eliminated by history. We must carry forward a new cultural system to change the spiritual and cultural qualities of the people."
 Generic_New_Life_Movement_desc:0 "We must weed the present body of corruption, bribery and ignorance, and establish a clean, effective administration based on the Four Virtues: proper rite, justice, honesty, and shame."
 Generic_Guerilla_Tradition_desc:0 "There is only so much we can tame the vast landscapes of Asia- and even then only the parts we control. We must ensure our new logistical supply chain can guarantee our brave troops can move far beyond where our civilian infrastructure ends."
 Generic_Purchase_Aircrafts_desc:0 "The Flying Circus program proved to us how Western craft can provide the much needed edge we've been looking for; unfortunately, not even our best efforts could replicate them domestically. Brokering deals with private contractors abroad seems like our best option."
 Generic_Design_New_Rifles_desc:0 "Modern firearms have advanced much further from "shoots metal at enemies when trigger is pulled". We must strive to design and produce a next generation of rifles that will let us get the edge over similar-sized armies."
 Generic_Design_New_Artillery_desc:0 "Our Artillery will form a single powerful unit to focus fire on specific points. One volley at a time and we will weaken the enemy line and punch our way through if we have to!"
 Generic_Extra_Navy_Leader_desc:0 "As our mighty fleet expands, so must our chain of command. We must find more capable admirals to lead our ships to glorious combat."
 Generic_Guarantee_Transportation_desc:0 "Without a working logistics system, we will not be able to maintain an army in the field."
 Generic_Improve_Ironmaking_desc:0 "From the humblest of guns to large floating behemoths, no armed force can exist without steel. We must ensure a steady domestic supply of at least part of our requirements on the metal."
 Generic_Drill_Oil_desc:0 "The future of every industrialised nation depends on its access to oil. We must identify potential deposits of the black gold in our own lands and exploit it accordingly."
 Generic_International_Study_Mission_desc:0 "With a booming industry and bright young intelligentsia, we truly can compete with the world in all sciences; but we don't have to. Instead we shall partner our newfound academemic weight with more advanced institutes across the world for the benefit of all parties."
 Generic_Purchase_Foreign_Cars_desc:0 "Wars in the West are won by vehicles far superior to anything we can produce ourselves. Negotiating for even a small amount of them can make the difference in Asian affairs."
 Generic_Anti_Aircraft_Warfare_desc:0 "Aircraft are complex and expensive, and it's hard to really outproduce our enemies in the skies. Thankfully, artillery shells do the job much cheaper. Fortifying our borders with static anti-air defenses will greatly relieve our air force to be used on the offensive instead."
 Generic_Extra_Land_Leader_desc:0 "As our mighty army expands, so must our chain of command. We must find more capable generals to lead our forces to glorious combat."
 Generic_Dare_To_Die_Corps_desc:0 "The struggle for the motherland has already created plenty of martyrs. There will be plenty more before it is over. Their sacrifices will be remembered by generations to come."
 Generic_Manage_Tungsten_Area_desc:0 "Tungsten can open the way for newer, better methods of production, as well as prove a decent anti-tank weapon. We shall focus our efforts on that front."
 Generic_Manage_Aluminium_Area_desc:0 "Though inferior metals do the trick just fine for your average vehicle, aluminum is needed for the next generation of warfare- both on land and sky. We shall focus our efforts on that front."
 Generic_National_Compulsory_Education_desc:0 "Everyone should have the privilege of studying to better themselves for their motherland, from the lowliest peasant to the wealthiest noble- no matter if they want to or not."
 Generic_Purchase_Foreign_Tanks_desc:0 "In the fires of the Great War a new weapon was forged: steel horses that can't be shot at by men, spewing flames and destruction. By studying prototypes obtained from abroad we can begin ourselves the assembly of our very own armoured divisions."
 Generic_Eliteism_desc:0 "For too long have we allowed our leadership to be bloated by people with no use other than their prestige or nobility. Every single one of our generals will have to prove his merit in both combat and leadership or be removed from his position- forcibly if needed."
 Generic_Military_Youth_desc:0 "A government-funded paramilitary group will help our next generation of valiant fighters to embrace the the needed discipline and align to our political goals before they have time to be influenced by foreign devils."
 Generic_Reorganize_the_Local_Army_desc:0 "As our borders stretch further and further, handling all matters of warfare by the central government alone proves to be nigh impossible. We shall instead relegate more autonomy to the local army structures, so that independent batallions can reorganise their offensive even disconnected from central command."
 Generic_War_Taxes_desc:0 "Desperate times require desperate measures. While the war continues, we must mobilize the economic resources of the population to the fullest possible extent."
 Generic_Spirit_of_Knight_Errant_desc:0 "If our men are content in the idea of dying and killing for their faith, why not for our ideals and values as a nation? We shall make it clear that whoever tries to escape glorious death in the heat of battle will find a much more humiliating one in the hands of their own comrades."
 Generic_Why_We_Fight_desc:0 "The world is growing increasingly unsafe. Our people need to see the atrocities being committed by those who crave power. It is time we rally the people to our cause and ensure everyone is ready to fight for our freedom."
 Generic_Modern_Cavalry_desc:0 "The Western "experts" who announced horse warfare dead have not tried driving tanks thousands of miles through the treacherous Asian terrain. However, we do need to modernise our cavalry divisions and establish better integration with the rest of our forces."
 Generic_Experimental_Motorized_Infantry_desc:0 "The general consensus for the future of armor in Europe is the combination of tactically flexible infantry on motor and light tanks to screen them. We shall raise such a unit."
 Generic_Elite_Mountaineers_desc:0 "Alpine Warfare is an entirely different beast than combat in the plains. We should train specialised divisions in this art to make the best use of our terrain."
 Generic_Elite_Marine_desc:0 "Our long coastline is vulnerable to enemy landings, but it also provides the opportunity to attack from an unexpected direction should an enemy invade overland."
 Generic_Bicycle_Infantry_desc:0 "Mobility is key. Our forces will be equipped with bicycles, drastically improving our ability to maneuver divisions around."
 Generic_Scorched_Earth_Tactics_desc:0 "In a struggle for national survival, nothing is unthinkable and every option must be considered."
 Generic_Forced_Loans_desc:0 "The merchants and industrialists have amassed incredible riches in the period of relative peace. It is surely not too much to ask them to make part of that wealth available for the government in these desperate times, with a promise of prompt repayment as soon as the situation permits."
 Generic_Industrial_Evacuations_desc:0 "A modern war is won in the factories. An army without guns is nothing but a group of people with silly hats."
 Generic_Recruit_Bandits_desc:0 "Every bullet spent hunting down bandits is one less available for the fight to come. Instead of fighting our own subjects, we should offer them a way to redeem themselves through service to the motherland."
 Generic_Elite_Desert_Infantry_desc:0 "Combat in the Desert ranges exposes troops to many perils, but sometimes cannot be avoided. Providing our soldiers with specialized training for this environment, we can minimize these risks."
 Generic_Elite_Forest_Infantry_desc:0 "Jaegers are forces that specialize in surviving the wilderness of the boreal forest. Usually these troops are native to their territorry and take a long time to train."
 Generic_Elite_Jungle_Infantry_desc:0 "Jungle Specialists are trained to sustain the harsh conditions of the Jungle Warfare and to cope with the frequent lack of supplies."
 Generic_Firepower_Effort_desc:0 "For those armies that focussed on firepower, another crucial decision revolved around how that firepower was to be utilized. One possibility was to craft intricate and detailed plans that integrated artillery strikes on specific targets timed to end just as the main assault was launched, while another possibility was simply to mass together as much artillery as possible and bombard the enemy until he gave way."
 Generic_Mobility_Effort_desc:0 "For those armies that focussed on mobility, it was important to decide how precisely the army was to be mobile. One option was to use standard infantry forces, and to overwhelm the enemy when contact was made, while another option was to focus on specialized spearhead units, often with a mechanized component, that were best suited for mobility and could quickly exploit weaknesses in the enemy line."
 Generic_Low_Level_Modern_Equipment_desc:0 "Now, we have the strength to develop some modern equipment, including armor, warships and aircraft. With these powerful firepower and high-speed mechanized equipment, we will be able to face another war that may occur after 20 years."
 Generic_Advanced_Modern_Equipment_desc:0 "Simply creating low-level modern equipment is not enough to change our backward military strength. If we are prepared, we should research some projects that the European and American powers are studying. Such as heavy tanks, battleships and bombers."
 Shared_Extra_Tech_Slot_desc:0 "Our industrial growth has attracted many learned minds, both nationals and foreign scientists looking for employment. We should fund research councils to ensure that they find tasks to work on, until our industrial base grows enough that we attract private research institutes."
 Shared_Plan_of_Reform_desc:0 "The modern age no longer allows our people to develop in blissful isolation. If we are to find our place in the sun, we need to take unprecedented leaps of reform and change this nation forever. This arduous journey begins now."

 Shared_Anti_Aircraft_Warfare_desc:0 "Aircraft are complex and expensive, and it's hard to really outproduce our enemies in the skies. Thankfully, artillery shells do the job much cheaper. Fortifying our borders with static anti-air defenses will greatly relieve our air force to be used on the offensive instead."
 Shared_Extra_Land_Leader_desc:0 "As our mighty army expands, so must our chain of command. We must find more capable generals to lead our forces to glorious combat."
 Shared_Dare_To_Die_Corps_desc:0 "The struggle for the motherland has already created plenty of martyrs. There will be plenty more before it is over. Their sacrifices will be remembered by generations to come."
 Shared_Manage_Tungsten_Area_desc:0 "Tungsten can open the way for newer, better methods of production, as well as prove a decent anti-tank weapon. We shall focus our efforts on that front."
 Shared_Manage_Aluminium_Area_desc:0 "Though inferior metals do the trick just fine for your average vehicle, aluminum is needed for the next generation of warfare- both on land and sky. We shall focus our efforts on that front."
 Shared_National_Compulsory_Education_desc:0 "Everyone should have the privilege of studying to better themselves for their motherland, from the lowliest peasant to the wealthiest noble- no matter if they want to or not."
 Shared_Purchase_Foreign_Tanks_desc:0 "In the fires of the Great War a new weapon was forged: steel horses that can't be shot at by men, spewing flames and destruction. By studying prototypes obtained from abroad we can begin ourselves the assembly of our very own armoured divisions."
 Shared_Eliteism_desc:0 "For too long have we allowed our leadership to be bloated by people with no use other than their prestige or nobility. Every single one of our generals will have to prove his merit in both combat and leadership or be removed from his position- forcibly if needed."
 Shared_Military_Youth_desc:0 "A government-funded paramilitary group will help our next generation of valiant fighters to embrace the the needed discipline and align to our political goals before they have time to be influenced by foreign devils."
 Shared_Reorganize_the_Local_Army_desc:0 "As our borders stretch further and further, handling all matters of warfare by the central government alone proves to be nigh impossible. We shall instead relegate more autonomy to the local army structures, so that independent batallions can reorganise their offensive even disconnected from central command."
 Shared_War_Taxes_desc:0 "Desperate times require desperate measures. While the war continues, we must mobilize the economic resources of the population to the fullest possible extent."
 Shared_Spirit_of_Knight_Errant_desc:0 "If our men are content in the idea of dying and killing for their faith, why not for our ideals and values as a nation? We shall make it clear that whoever tries to escape glorious death in the heat of battle will find a much more humiliating one in the hands of their own comrades."
 Shared_Why_We_Fight_desc:0 "The world is growing increasingly unsafe. Our people need to see the atrocities being committed by those who crave power. It is time we rally the people to our cause and ensure everyone is ready to fight for our freedom."
 Shared_Modern_Cavalry_desc:0 "The Western "experts" who announced horse warfare dead have not tried driving tanks thousands of miles through the treacherous Asian terrain. However, we do need to modernise our cavalry divisions and establish better integration with the rest of our forces."
 Shared_Experimental_Motorized_Infantry_desc:0 "The general consensus for the future of armor in Europe is the combination of tactically flexible infantry on motor and light tanks to screen them. We shall raise such a unit."
 Shared_Elite_Mountaineers_desc:0 "Alpine Warfare is an entirely different beast than combat in the plains. We should train specialised divisions in this art to make the best use of our terrain."
 Shared_Elite_Marine_desc:0 "Our long coastline is vulnerable to enemy landings, but it also provides the opportunity to attack from an unexpected direction should an enemy invade overland."
 Shared_Bicycle_Infantry_desc:0 "Mobility is key. Our forces will be equipped with bicycles, drastically improving our ability to maneuver divisions around."
 Shared_Scorched_Earth_Tactics_desc:0 "In a struggle for national survival, nothing is unthinkable and every option must be considered."
 Shared_Forced_Loans_desc:0 "The merchants and industrialists have amassed incredible riches in the period of relative peace. It is surely not too much to ask them to make part of that wealth available for the government in these desperate times, with a promise of prompt repayment as soon as the situation permits."
 Shared_Industrial_Evacuations_desc:0 "A modern war is won in the factories. An army without guns is nothing but a group of people with silly hats."
 Shared_Recruit_Bandits_desc:0 "Every bullet spent hunting down bandits is one less available for the fight to come. Instead of fighting our own subjects, we should offer them a way to redeem themselves through service to the motherland."
 Shared_Elite_Desert_Infantry_desc:0 "Combat in the Desert ranges exposes troops to many perils, but sometimes cannot be avoided. Providing our soldiers with specialized training for this environment, we can minimize these risks."
 Shared_Elite_Forest_Infantry_desc:0 "Jaegers are forces that specialize in surviving the wilderness of the boreal forest. Usually these troops are native to their territorry and take a long time to train."
 Shared_Elite_Jungle_Infantry_desc:0 "Jungle Specialists are trained to sustain the harsh conditions of the Jungle Warfare and to cope with the frequent lack of supplies."
 Shared_Firepower_Effort_desc:0 "For those armies that focussed on firepower, another crucial decision revolved around how that firepower was to be utilized. One possibility was to craft intricate and detailed plans that integrated artillery strikes on specific targets timed to end just as the main assault was launched, while another possibility was simply to mass together as much artillery as possible and bombard the enemy until he gave way."
 Shared_Mobility_Effort_desc:0 "For those armies that focussed on mobility, it was important to decide how precisely the army was to be mobile. One option was to use standard infantry forces, and to overwhelm the enemy when contact was made, while another option was to focus on specialized spearhead units, often with a mechanized component, that were best suited for mobility and could quickly exploit weaknesses in the enemy line."
 Shared_Low_Level_Modern_Equipment_desc:0 "Now, we have the strength to develop some modern equipment, including armor, warships and aircraft. With these powerful firepower and high-speed mechanized equipment, we will be able to face another war that may occur after 20 years."
 Shared_Advanced_Modern_Equipment_desc:0 "Simply creating low-level modern equipment is not enough to change our backward military strength. If we are prepared, we should research some projects that the European and American powers are studying. Such as heavy tanks, battleships and bombers."
