 Radical_Leftist_ideology_desc:0 "A general term , Radical Leftists refer to the ideologies that are left-wing revolutionary in nature and seek the upheaval of the existing status quo. The Radical Leftists consider China at a very necessary time of revolution to free her from imperialist chains, and they are very inclined to the potentialsof working people— an almost newborn social class in China. Cooperation with Peasants, on the other hand is sharing diverse opinion among the ideology holders. Nevertheless, they seek to collectivise property and ends the landowner system while rejecting genuine capitalism that will not bring a bright future. The two major branches are the Bolsheviks, which are very-recently inspired by the revolution in Russia and Anarchists, which appeared as early as the overthrow of Manchu dynasty."
 Radical_Rightist_ideology_desc:0 "Although the founder of Fascism only begins his career in 1919 March, the far-right proto-Fascism have a more esoteric origin even at the begining of comparative politics. Staunchly traditionalistic and oppose introduced ideas from outside, the Radical Rightist seek to achieve the past glories of mandate of heaven by any means necessary, whether by forming a ultra militaristic, traditionalist or religious goverment with intrigue groups pulling the string. Conversely, this ideology can also refer to the introduced heavily Anti-Communist and Militaristic governments by those who invade China."
 Moderate_Leftist_ideology_desc:0 "A variation of the common Socially Democratic ideology in the West, the Moderate are more focused on progressivism and localization issues. They aim to use the democratic system to promote civil progression on the traditional hierarchies, build but reform capitalism to prevent exploitation and build a common nation identity in the modernizing process. However, despite the democratic intentions and natures of their doctrine, they may still be temporarily authoritarian to use a strong hand for the process of reform and modernization. The major branch is Principle of the Three People, which is the guiding ideology of Kuomingtang. Social Democratic or Left-wing Populism also falls into this category."
 Moderate_Rightist_ideology_desc:0 "A more moderate and modest model of Western Liberal Democratic ideologies, The Moderate Rightists seek to achieve a more moderate formation of Western system, accepting Western values but also wishes to preserve traditional beliefs in politics and civil life. Opponent to both status quo and radical revolutions, they usually advocates for plans of steadfast reforms and are more inclined to promote democratic, plutocratic, decentralized systems. They will defend the political rights and economical rights of individuals as well as traditional power organics in the society, despite they can be also be more economically left or conservative. The major two branches are Chinese federalism, which is a decentralized concept advocated by Chen Jiongming and Right-wing Kuomingtang’s national conservertivism line. Standard Market Liberalism and liberals within Beiyang goverment also belongs to this category."
 Centrist_ideology_desc:0 "Originated from the late army reforms of Qing army, the offciers and Warlords quickly gained regional controls in the post-Yuan Shikai China due to the power vacuum. A warlord rule can be brutal and harsh, while some other more benevolent situations leave residents at ease and relative economically stable development compared to regions at war. Notice that this ideology also applies to colonies around the world, as indenpendence of the affairs in these regions may only effect to a confederate level at most. The Political Tutelage leadership of the KMT is also represented as Centrist, leaning neither Right or Left wing."
