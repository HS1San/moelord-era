 MAY_FOURTH_MOVEMENT_NAME:0 "May Fourth Movement"
 MAY_FOURTH_MOVEMENT_DESC:0 "On May 4, 1919, countless Chinese youths flocked to the streets of Beijing to protest the diplomatic incompetence of the Beiyang government. The dispute over Qingdao’s problems finally ignited the Chinese’s determination to resist imperialism and hegemony. This movement is regarded as the beginning of China's new-democratic revolution, the storm of revolution will soon sweep across the land of China."
 CGD_MAY_FOURTH_MOVEMENT_DESC:0 "As the origin of the revolution, Guangdong has been defending China's democracy and republicanism. Although the results of the third revolution were once again destroyed by warlords, the concept of freedom and equality was not stifled. In southern Fujian, Chen Jiongming has established a revolutionary center and is ready to return to Guangdong under Sun Wen's order. But at the same time, the cooperation between the moderate Chen and the radical Sun may not last long under the intervention of the Soviet Russia..."
 CFT_MAY_FOURTH_MOVEMENT_DESC:0 "Just like the dilemma that other warlords have encountered, the three northeastern provinces also have his chaos. The ambitious Zhang Zuolin has won the title of governor of the three northeastern provinces last year. However, there is a last obstacle in front of him - Meng Enyuan, the governor of Jilin. If the northeast war broke out, the results were still unknown. However, it is worth noting that on the northeastern railway line, the Sun flag seems to be indicating that something is going to happen..."
 CZL_MAY_FOURTH_MOVEMENT_DESC:0 "Strictly speaking, Zhili Clique is just a general term for a large number of warlords with different temperaments. But the overlapping interests between them are enough to sustain this fragile alliance. From the perspective of fear and resentment against Duan Qirui, the warlords of Zhili Clique are eager for a Beiyang general to lead themselves. This person is Feng Guofan. But as time goes by, aging is eroding the status of this leader. Zhili Clique is suffering the most serious challenge ever, and warlords without leaders must not be able to compete with Anhui Clique. A new leader will be the key to reversing the situation..."
 CBJ_MAY_FOURTH_MOVEMENT_DESC:0 "In the past few years, Duan Qirui and his loyal followers have continued to climb in the unfamiliar society stipulated in the Republican Charter. As one of China's most influential and complex factions, Anhui Clique controls the Congress in Beijing. Duan's influence has spread to every corner of the government. Despite this, Anhui Clique still has to face the challenge of unity and legitimacy from its own. Congressional politicians are still eager to rebuild a republic under a bureaucratic rule. Zhili Clique and Fengtian Clique continue to threaten Duan's crumbling hegemony. In the upcoming storm, Anhui Clique will find itself isolated and vulnerable."
 CSX_MAY_FOURTH_MOVEMENT_DESC:0 "The Revolution of 1911 brought a good opportunity for the rulers of Shanxi to leave the central government and turn to autonomy. Thanks to Yan Xishan’s cunning foreign policy, the war of warlords has never crossed the provincial boundaries of Shanxi. Therefore, Shanxi was able to carry out economic and military construction. Faced with the conflict between Zhili Clique and Anhui Clique, Shanxi Clique seems to have smelled the smell before the storm. They must make a decision before Mars ignites. Any mistakes will break the fragile balance of Shanxi..."
 CSC_MAY_FOURTH_MOVEMENT_DESC:0 "In Sichuan, the factions in this paradise-like province are innumerable. Now, Xiong Kewu, the hero of the past, finally returned to Sichuan. However, even so, the hero was quite dissatisfied with Yang Shukan appointed by Sun Wen. The industrial faction has been prepared to unite Yang to overthrow Xiong's rule. At the same time, the army of Yunnan and the army of Guizhou are also staring at Sichuan. It is still unclear whether the story that Sichuan will circulate is “Golden Mountain” or “Scarred Dragon”..."
 CYN_MAY_FOURTH_MOVEMENT_DESC:0 "Yunnan may never have many factions like other warlords, which contributes to the stability and development of this remote province to a certain extent. But no one can prove that Yunnan Clique is afraid of war. As the leader of the National Protection War, the squadrons who are fighting outside still carry memories of defending the Republic. Now, Yunnan still considers itself an arbiter of the Republic. Although this is far from the truth, few people want to challenge the prestige and status of Yunnan Clique."
 OTHER_MAY_FOURTH_MOVEMENT_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 CSH_MAY_FOURTH_MOVEMENT_DESC:0 "Among all the concessions that emerged in modern China, the Shanghai Concession was the earliest and most developed region. The prosperous Shanghai was called the “Adventurer Paradise”. It was the hell of the poor and the paradise of the rich. As a bridge between Western modern and traditional China, the two worlds have merged here to create the Oriental Magic Capital.\nA young man stood on the banks of the Huangpu River and looked at the changes in the world. The times are constantly changing, and the characters are constantly emerging and disappearing, but the constant is the rushing river."
 MON_MAY_FOURTH_MOVEMENT_DESC:0 "Long submitting to the thumb of Qing dynasty’s Manchu rulers, Mongolia has made good use of the 1911 revolution, who declared independence the same year. Under the rule of Bogd Khan - the 8th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, religious leader of Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia, Mongolia faces serve threat from both internal turmoil and Chinese attempt to reassert control as well Russian and Japanese involvement. This has come to a crackling point when the Russian civil war goes full blown, and escalation of conflict rebursts in China."
 TAN_MAY_FOURTH_MOVEMENT_DESC:0 "In the center of Eastern Central Asia is Tannu Urainkhai, a now in-conflict region that are now occupied by Chinese troops. Tannu Urainkhai has a history of being taken by both Han and Mongol forces after it was taken away by the Manchus when the Mongol empire collapses, then it faced an rapid increase in Russian emigration and annexation after the Qing empire collapses. However, the collapse of the Russian empire created a shift in the regional power balance. What fate awaits?"
 
 
 RED_TIDE_NAME:0 "Red Tide"
 RED_TIDE_DESC:0 "In early 1919, the infinite snow fluttered over the Russian soil as always. The battle of Tsaritsyn accompanied by iron and blood is still deadlocked. The snow that is slightly stronger than in previous years has revealed the curtain of the final drama from time to time. The opera will have a short time to end, but the participants frowned. When the curtain fell, no one was unwilling to be the master of flowers and wine, even though they themselves were not united."

 welcome_text:0 "§YIntroducing Autumn Begonia - Under the Auspicious Cloud§!\nAutumn Begonia brings players to one of the most overlooked, misunderstood yet intriguing and dynamic periods of modern history: The Warlord Era of China. Autumn Begonia begins on the 4th of May 1919, the day the movement of the same name found life. Fresh with a brand new Sino-centric map, unique economic, political, and bureaucratic mechanics, Autumn Begonia will give the player a fully authentic and immersive experience of the Warlord Era within the framework of Hearts of Iron IV, as a merger of the Minor Bookmarks: Warlord Era mod and the unpublished pre-merge Golden Decade project.\n\nThe day is May 4th, 1919 and from the gardens of Versailles to the streets of Peking - Chinese students protest at the injustice of the Paris Peace Conference. Despite shedding much blood for the Triple Entente in the Great War, Chinese requests to be treated with respect and dignity on the International Stage have fallen on deaf ears and the Western Imperialists have sought to hand over rightful Chinese territory in Shandong to their Japanese lapdogs. Duan Qirui's Anhui Clique finds itself invoking the ire of the aforementioned movement over collaboration with Japan. The Zhili Clique’s leader Feng Guozhang knows he is nearing his end but wishes to realize his fleeting dream of peace with the South, where revolutionary forces plot to create a new and progressive China in Sun Yat-sen’s vision - should they reach the Northern Capital without their internal squabbles tearing them apart. To the North, the Old Marshal of Zhang Zuolin eyes the province of Jilin and intends to deport its leader Meng En-yuan, the first in a long trail to power. The future of the Middle Kingdom remains unclear but one thing remains certain: China’s present will be fraught with violence and destruction, with iron and blood - but its future is up to you."
