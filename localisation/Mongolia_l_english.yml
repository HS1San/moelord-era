  MON_Fight_Back_Against_Semyonov_desc:0 "Irredentist ideologies like Pan-Mongolism are dangerous, and put us at odds with our neighbors. With the Inner Mongolian warlords apart of larger cliques, we should make it clear we wish to avoid Conflict."

  MON_Liberation_of_Tuva_desc:0 "Tannu Uriankahi is vulnerable. If not threatned by us, by the Reds and Whites across it's border. We must liberate the Tuvans people by bringing them into Mongolia. Their culture and customs are similar enough so that we may assimilate them as our own."
  MON_Accept_Chinese_Sovereignty_desc:0 "Although it pains us to do so, we must return to the Chinese sphere of influence. It is better to be autonomous, than outright subjugated."
  MON_Aid_Against_Semyonov_desc:0 "Semyonov has been a thorn in many people's sides, and it's best we exile him before he has the chance to stir up trouble with Beijing. The fact that he commands troops outside of our control is destined to cause conflict."

  MON_A_New_Government_desc:0 "The Fiver-Races under one union flag features five colors, representing equally all the races of China. Blue represents Mongols, and with Autonomy under Beijing, we shall finally achieve equality with the Han Chinese, while also having Beijing's protection."
